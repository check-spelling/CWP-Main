GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Following the end of the Second World War with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Imperial Japanese, the World has revolutionaized itself. Never has the threat of Nuclear Warfare been higher, never has the world been more uncertain. Europe has been divided between two blocs. These being the Allies and the Comintern, Fascism being mostly eradicated from the face of the earth, two ideologies are in direct competition with one another. Capitalisim vs Communisim. The world it at an uncertain and uneven age, yet it has never been more developed. Inventions that would've taken decades in peacetime are being made in months. What future will this world hold for those inside of it?"
